# ModBounce

ModBounce is a game oriented synth controller, which uses the wandering nature of bouncing balls to control synth parameters in an experimental and playful context.

The GUI for this game has been developed in *Processing**, whilst its sound engine has been developed in *Supercollider*.

Please see Wiki page for further details.

The physics of a bouncing ball restricted by boundaries and provoked by obstacles, is erratic, abundant in variation and fitting for music composition; or at

Randomness, improvisation, creativity..(research and reference)
Within music production, particularly live music production (or composition), improvisation is regarded a useful tool, not only for adding variation but also, 
breaking through creative blocks and broadening the
