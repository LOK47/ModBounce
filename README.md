# ModBounce

ModBounce is a game oriented synth and pattern controller, which uses the wandering nature of bouncing balls to control synth parameters in an experimental and playful context.

The GUI for this game has been developed in *Processing*, whilst its sound engine has been developed in *Supercollider*.

Please see Wiki page for further details. 




<b>Instructions</b>

1. Please run the <i>Processing</i> sketch before booting the <i>Supercollider</i> server and evaluating the code.
This allows <i>Processing<i> to gate the sounds before they start playing and saves your ears!  

2. Evaluate <i>Supercollider<i> code in consecutive order.

3. Have fun, change stuff around, feel free to share it with me :)
